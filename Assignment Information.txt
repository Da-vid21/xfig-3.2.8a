When an object is added the objects don't have depth properties as all elements are on the same Z-axis
This makes the drawing confusing as it confuses on which object was added first and last
The objective is to increase the depth of new objects by 1 when added to the drawing
You will need to add w_indpanel.c as that is the file that has the depth value properties for every object

Steps
1. Open Visual Studio Code or your choice of IDE(open it from GitHub)
2. Check if you have opened the whole folder if now open the whole xfig folder
3. Click on the search icon on the left toolbar and search "#defaultDepth" you should see 8 files to edit
4. Use the direction provided as comments to work on the assignment
