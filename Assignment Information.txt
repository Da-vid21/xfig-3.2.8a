Github Issue - https://github.com/Da-vid21/xfig-3.2.8a/issues/2
Look at the GitHub to get assignment Information in depth
The goal of this project is to unlock the predefined angles xfig.
Xfig has currently locked the rotation angles to 90 and 180 angles, you need to change that to accept any angles
The project would be removing the predefined angles and let xfig accept float numbers

Steps
1. Open Visual Studio Code or your choice of IDE(open it from GitHub)
2. Check if you have opened the whole folder if now open the whole xfig folder
3. Click on the search icon on the left toolbar and search "#enhancedRotation". You should see two files with the hashtag.
4. Use the direction provided as comments to work on the assignment

How to Check
**Once you are done there should be two files that are edited and you should compile your code using the compile.sh tocheck if your solution works
**If your code doesn't work try to check on your work and look for errors or try to redo you work
