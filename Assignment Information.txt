This feature will make an icon available to select multiple objects using a rectangular box and move them at the same time
Look at the GitHub to get assignment Information in depth

We have 2 files named e_ffst.c and e_ffst.h this two files have the behavior of selecting multiple objects
In this project the goal is to create an icon and attach it behaviors to make a working tool

**If you include e_ffst.h into the files using the comments it will automatically include the behavior to the file  

Steps
1. Open Visual Studio Code or your choice of IDE(open it from GitHub)
2. Check if you have opened the whole folder if now open the whole xfig folder
3. Click on the search icon on the left toolbar and search "#freeSelection". You should see four files with the hashtag.
4. Use the direction provided as comments to work on the assignment
