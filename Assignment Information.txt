TASK DEFAULT DEPTH

DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS: 
https://github.com/Da-vid21/xfig-3.2.8a/issues/1

GOAL: 
The goal of this project is to automatically increment the depth of new objects when they are added to the drawing.
When an object is added, it does not have depth properties. All elements are on the same Z-axis.
This makes the drawing confusing. It is not clear which object was added first and last.
You will need to change the properties of the objects in xfig to increment their depth when added.
                       
**You will need to add "w_indpanel.h" to every file you edit. That is the file that has the depth value properties for every object.

STEPS:
1. Open Visual Studio Code or your choice of IDE(open it from GitHub).
2. Check if you have opened the whole xfig folder.
3. Click on the search icon on the left toolbar and search "#defaultDepth". **You should see 7 files to edit.
4. Use the directions provided as comments to work on the assignment.       **Try to work in the alphabetical order you see in VS Code.
5. Go to the desktop and double-click the 'compile.sh' file.
