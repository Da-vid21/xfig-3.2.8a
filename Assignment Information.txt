Github Issue - https://github.com/Da-vid21/xfig-3.2.8a/issues/2
Look at the GitHub to get assignment Information in depth.
The goal of this project is to unlock the predefined angles xfig.
Xfig has currently locked the rotation angles to 90 and 180 angles, you need to change that to accept any angles.
The project would be removing the predefined angles and let xfig accept float numbers.

Steps
1. Open Visual Studio Code or your choice of IDE(open it from GitHub).
2. Check if you have opened the whole xfig folder.
3. Click on the search icon on the left toolbar and search "#enhancedRotation". You should see two files with the hashtag.
4. Use the directions provided as comments to work on the assignment.


**Try to look at the youtube videos if you get confused at any point.

How to Check
**Once you are done, there should be two files that are edited. You should compile your code using the file 'compile.sh' to check if your solution works.
**To change the values of the angles click on rotate at the left toolbar. At the bottom, click on Rotn angle box and change the angle to check if it works.
**If your code doesn't work, try to check on your work and look for errors or try to redo your work.
