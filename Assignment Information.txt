SEND TO BACK 

DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS: 
https://github.com/Da-vid21/xfig-3.2.8a/

GOAL:
The goal of this project is to create two new shortcut buttons for send-to-back and bring-to-front. 
These buttons will allow the user to change the depth of selected objects. 
The user will be able to select an object and bring it to the top or bottom layer for easier workflow.

STEPS:
1. Open Visual Studio Code or your choice of IDE(open it from GitHub).
2. Check if you have opened the whole xfig folder.
3. Click on the search icon on the left toolbar and search "#taskSendBack". **You should see 5 files with the hashtag.
4. Use the directions provided as comments to work on the assignment.
5. After you have added all of your changes, you will need to reconfigure xfig. Instructions to do so can be found in this tutorial: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jCuZicXADVljUd1Lvru3TrpHa8UNvfvC/view
6. Go to the desktop and compile your code double-clicking the 'compile.sh' file to check if your solution works.
