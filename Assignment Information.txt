The goal of this project is to unlock the predefined angles xfig.
Xfig has currently locked the rotation angles to 90 and 180 angles, you need to change that to accept any angles
The project would be removing the predefined angles and let xfig accept float numbers

Steps:

1. Open GitHub Desktop
2. Open xfig-3.2.8a repository
3. On the top tool bar, change the current branch to "Project-1-Enhanced-Rotation"
4. Click on "Open in Visual Studio Code" (VS Code might be changed to your convinience by another IDE)
5. On VS Code, go to the left tool bar and click on the search icon
6. Type in "#enhancedRotation" in the search box. You should see two files with the hashtag.
7. Click on each file (files ending with .c ) and read the comments
