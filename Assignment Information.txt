TASK UNDO REDO

DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS: 
https://github.com/Da-vid21/xfig-3.2.8a/issues/7 - GitHub Issue

GOAL:
The current Undo feature needs to be enhanced to support multi-level undo. 
This new feature will allow a user to undo or redo an unlimited number of times. 
The maximum number of undo/redo operations is only limited by the amount of available memory 
determined by the computer system. 

**TIP: It is important that you understand what you will be implementing before you go in and create certain methods.
It is reccomended that you read through and analyze the entire u_undo.c file before attempting to code as this will help
you understand the methods you will be creating and why they are being created.

STEPS:
1. Open Visual Studio Code or your choice of IDE(open it from GitHub)
2. Click on the search icon on the left toolbar and search "#taskUndoRedo".
3. Use the direction provided as comments to work on the assignment.
5. Go to the desktop and double click the configure.sh file to compile/test.
